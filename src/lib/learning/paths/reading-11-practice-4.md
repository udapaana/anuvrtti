## concept - Participles Preview

You're seeing past participles (@deva[निमग्नः], @deva[प्रस्थितः]) — verb forms used as adjectives:

- @deva[निमग्न] — "sunk" (from @deva[नि-मज्ज्] "to sink")
- @deva[प्रस्थित] — "departed" (from @deva[प्र-स्था] "to set out")

These agree with the noun they describe in gender/number/case.

- @deva[च] — "and"
- @deva[पुनः] — "again"
- @deva[बलम्] — "strength" (accusative)
- @deva[प्राप्य] — "having obtained" (absolutive)
- @deva[उत्थितः] — "rose" (past participle)

**Translation:** "And he, having regained strength, rose."

## concept - Absolutives Preview

The absolutive (@deva[-त्वा], @deva[-य]) means "having done X":

- @deva[विहाय] — "having abandoned"
- @deva[प्राप्य] — "having obtained"

It shows an action completed before the main action.
