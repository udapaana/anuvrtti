## concept - Why Compounds?

Sanskrit loves compounds. Instead of @deva[राजस्य पुत्रः] "the king's son," Sanskrit often writes @deva[राजपुत्रः] — one word.

Recognizing compounds is essential for reading fluency.

## concept - Tatpuruṣa: "Of/For/From" Compounds

The most common type (@ref[2.1.22]). The first word modifies the second:

| Compound          | Split                 | Meaning              |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| @deva[राजपुत्रः]  | @deva[राजस्य पुत्रः]  | "king's son"         |
| @deva[ग्रामगमनम्] | @deva[ग्रामं गमनम्]   | "going to village"   |
| @deva[विद्याधनम्] | @deva[विद्यायाः धनम्] | "wealth of learning" |

The case relationship is hidden inside.

## concept - Recognizing Tatpuruṣa

The **last member** determines:

- Gender and number
- The "head" meaning

@deva[राजपुत्रः] — masculine because @deva[पुत्र] is masculine
@deva[राजपुत्री] — feminine, "king's daughter"

---

## concept - Karmadhāraya: Adjective + Noun

When an adjective combines with a noun:

| Compound        | Split             | Meaning       |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| @deva[महाराजः]  | @deva[महान् राजा] | "great king"  |
| @deva[नीलकमलम्] | @deva[नीलं कमलम्] | "blue lotus"  |
| @deva[सज्जनः]   | @deva[सत् जनः]    | "good person" |

Both parts refer to the same thing.

---

## concept - Dvandva: "And" Compounds

Two or more items joined with "and" (@ref[2.2.29]):

| Compound           | Split                    | Meaning             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| @deva[रामलक्ष्मणौ] | @deva[रामः च लक्ष्मणः च] | "Rama and Lakṣmaṇa" |
| @deva[सुखदुःखे]    | @deva[सुखं च दुःखं च]    | "pleasure and pain" |
| @deva[पाणिपादम्]   | @deva[पाणी च पादौ च]     | "hands and feet"    |

The compound takes dual/plural based on count.

---

## concept - Bahuvrīhi: Possessive Compounds

Describes something by what it HAS (@ref[2.2.24]). The compound is an adjective:

| Compound         | Meaning                   | Describes   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- |
| @deva[महाबाहुः]  | "having great arms"       | a person    |
| @deva[चक्रपाणिः] | "having a discus in hand" | Viṣṇu       |
| @deva[पीताम्बरः] | "having yellow garments"  | Viṣṇu/Kṛṣṇa |

The compound doesn't mean "great arm" but "one with great arms."

---

## concept - Splitting Practice

Split these compounds:

1. @deva[वनगजः] = @deva[वनस्य गजः] "forest elephant"
2. @deva[पुष्पवृष्टिः] = @deva[पुष्पाणां वृष्टिः] "rain of flowers"
3. @deva[दीर्घबाहुः] = "having long arms" (bahuvrīhi)
4. @deva[धनधान्यम्] = @deva[धनं च धान्यं च] "wealth and grain"

---

## concept - Lesson Summary

Four common compound types:

1. **Tatpuruṣa**: case relationship (@deva[राजपुत्रः])
2. **Karmadhāraya**: adjective + noun (@deva[महाराजः])
3. **Dvandva**: X and Y (@deva[सुखदुःखे])
4. **Bahuvrīhi**: "having X" (@deva[महाबाहुः])
