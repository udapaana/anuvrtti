Split:
- @deva[तस्मिन् अद्रौ] — "on that mountain" (loc.)

- @deva[मासान्] — "months" (acc. pl.)
- @deva[कनक-वलय-भ्रंश-रिक्त-प्रकोष्ठः]
  - "gold-bracelet-falling-empty-forearms"
  - Bahuvrīhi: "whose forearms are empty from the falling of golden bracelets"

**Translation:** "...having passed some months, his forearms empty from slipping bracelets..."

## concept - Physical Grief

The compound @deva[कनकवलयभ्रंशरिक्तप्रकोष्ठः] shows:

The yakṣa has wasted away from grief — his bracelets no longer fit. Sanskrit poetry often shows emotion through physical description.

## reading - The Vision

@deva[वप्रक्रीडापरिणतगजप्रेक्षणीयं ददर्श]

Split:
- @deva[वप्र-क्रीडा-परिणत-गज-प्रेक्षणीयम्]
  - "rampart-play-bent-elephant-worth-seeing"
  - "resembling an elephant bent from playing against a rampart"
- @deva[ददर्श] — "he saw" (perfect tense)

**Translation:** "...resembling an elephant playfully butting a rampart — he saw [this cloud]."

## concept - The Full Verse

> On that mountain, that love-sick one, separated from his slender wife, having passed some months with forearms empty from slipping bracelets, on the first day of Āṣāḍha saw a cloud embracing the peak — resembling an elephant playfully butting a rampart.

This sets up the entire poem: the cloud will become the yakṣa's messenger.

## reading - A Final Subhāṣita

@deva[उद्यमेन हि सिध्यन्ति कार्याणि न मनोरथैः।]
@deva[न हि सुप्तस्य सिंहस्य प्रविशन्ति मुखे मृगाः॥]

- @deva[मनोरथैः] — "by wishes" (inst. pl.)
- @deva[सुप्तस्य सिंहस्य] — "of a sleeping lion" (gen.)
- @deva[प्रविशन्ति] — "enter"
- @deva[मुखे] — "into the mouth" (loc.)
- @deva[मृगाः] — "deer" (nom. pl.)
