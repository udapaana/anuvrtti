## concept - Subject + Verb

The simplest Sanskrit sentence has a subject and a verb:

@deva[नरः गच्छति] — "The man goes"
@deva[बालकः पठति] — "The boy reads"

The subject ends in @deva[-ः] (visarga). The verb ends in @deva[-ति].

---

## concept - Present Tense Endings

For "he/she/it" actions, verbs end in @deva[-ति]:

| Root | Meaning | Present |
|------|---------|---------|
| @deva[गम्] | go | @deva[गच्छति] |
| @deva[पठ्] | read | @deva[पठति] |
| @deva[वद्] | speak | @deva[वदति] |
| @deva[खाद्] | eat | @deva[खादति] |
| @deva[पश्] | see | @deva[पश्यति] |

---

## concept - Adding an Object

Add an object with @deva[-म्] ending:

@deva[नरः फलं खादति] — "The man eats the fruit"
- @deva[नरः] = subject (the man)
- @deva[फलम्] = object (the fruit)
- @deva[खादति] = verb (eats)

@deva[बालकः पुस्तकं पठति] — "The boy reads the book"

---

## concept - Word Order

Sanskrit word order is flexible. These mean the same:

@deva[नरः फलं खादति]
@deva[फलं नरः खादति]
@deva[खादति नरः फलम्]

The endings (not position) show who does what.
