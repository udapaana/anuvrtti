## reading - The Exiled Yakṣa

**Source:** Meghadūta 1.1

@deva[कश्चित्कान्ताविरहगुरुणा स्वाधिकारात्प्रमत्तः]

Split the compounds:
- @deva[कश्चित्] — "a certain" (indefinite pronoun)
- @deva[कान्ताविरहगुरुणा] = @deva[कान्ता-विरह-गुरुणा]
  - @deva[कान्ता] — "beloved"
  - @deva[विरह] — "separation"
  - @deva[गुरुणा] — "by heaviness" (inst.)
- @deva[स्वाधिकारात्] = @deva[स्व-अधिकारात्] — "from his own duty"
- @deva[प्रमत्तः] — "negligent" (past participle)

**Translation:** "A certain [yakṣa], negligent of his duties, weighed down by separation from his beloved..."

---

## concept - Bahuvrīhi in Action

@deva[कान्ताविरहगुरुणा] is a bahuvrīhi compound:

"heavy with separation from beloved" — describes the yakṣa, not the heaviness itself.

It answers: "What kind of yakṣa?" → "One heavy with separation."

## reading - The Curse

@deva[शापेनास्तंगमितमहिमा वर्षभोग्येण भर्तुः]

Split:
- @deva[शापेन] — "by a curse" (inst.)
- @deva[अस्तंगमितमहिमा] = @deva[अस्तंगमित-महिमा]
  - "eclipsed-glory" (bahuvrīhi: "whose glory was eclipsed")
- @deva[वर्षभोग्येण] = @deva[वर्ष-भोग्येण]
  - "to-be-experienced-for-a-year" (duration)
- @deva[भर्तुः] — "of/from the master" (gen./abl.)

**Translation:** "...his glory eclipsed by a curse from his master, [lasting] a year..."

---

## reading - His Dwelling

@deva[यक्षश्चक्रे जनकतनयास्नानपुण्योदकेषु]

Split:
- @deva[यक्षः] — "the yakṣa" (nom.)
- @deva[चक्रे] — "made" (perfect middle)
- @deva[जनकतनयास्नानपुण्योदकेषु] — a long compound!
  - @deva[जनक-तनया] — "Janaka's daughter" (= Sītā)
  - @deva[स्नान] — "bathing"
  - @deva[पुण्य] — "holy/purified"
  - @deva[उदकेषु] — "in waters" (loc. pl.)

**Translation:** "...the yakṣa made [his dwelling] in waters sanctified by Sītā's bathing..."

---

## reading - The Trees

@deva[स्निग्धच्छायातरुषु वसतिं रामगिर्याश्रमेषु]

Split:
- @deva[स्निग्धच्छायातरुषु] = @deva[स्निग्ध-छाया-तरुषु]
  - @deva[स्निग्ध] — "cool/pleasant"
  - @deva[छाया] — "shade"
  - @deva[तरुषु] — "among trees" (loc. pl.)
- @deva[वसतिम्] — "dwelling" (acc.)
- @deva[रामगिर्याश्रमेषु] = @deva[रामगिरि-आश्रमेषु]
  - "in the hermitages of Rāmagiri"

**Translation:** "...beneath trees of cool shade, in the hermitages of Rāmagiri."

---

## concept - The Full Verse

Putting it together:

> A certain yakṣa, negligent of his duties due to the weight of separation from his beloved, his glory eclipsed by a year-long curse from his master, made his dwelling in the hermitages of Rāmagiri — where the waters are sanctified by Sītā's bathing, beneath trees of cool shade.

---

## concept - Compound-Heavy Style

Kāvya poetry uses **long compounds** for:
- Compression (one word = many relationships)
- Sound beauty (smooth flow)
- Multiple meanings (puns)

With practice, you'll split these naturally.

- Splitting long compounds
