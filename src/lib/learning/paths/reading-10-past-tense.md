**Formation:** @deva[अ-] prefix + stem + endings

@deva[गच्छति] "goes" → @deva[अगच्छत्] "went"

## concept - The अ- Prefix (Augment)

The @deva[अ-] prefix signals past tense:

- @deva[गच्छति] → @deva[अगच्छत्]
- @deva[पठति] → @deva[अपठत्]

If the verb starts with a vowel, the @deva[अ] combines:
- @deva[इच्छति] → @deva[ऐच्छत्] (अ + इ → ऐ)

## concept - Reading Past Narrative

When you see @deva[अ-] + verb stem + @deva[-त्], it's past tense:

@deva[राजा अगच्छत्] — "The king went"
@deva[नरः अपश्यत्] — "The man saw"
@deva[बालकाः अपठन्] — "The boys read" (plural: @deva[-न्])
