## 1.1.1 - Vrddhi defined

**Key Terms:** vRddi, AT, Ec

@deva[आ], @deva[ऐ], and @deva[औ] are called @deva[वृद्धि]. These are the "strengthened" vowel grades. They appear in derivatives like @deva[आङ्गः] from @deva[अङ्ग], or @deva[औपगवः] from @deva[उपगु].

---

## 1.1.2 - Guna defined

**Key Terms:** guRa, at, eN

@deva[अ], @deva[ए], and @deva[ओ] are called @deva[गुण]. These are the "medium" vowel grades. They appear when roots change before endings: @deva[ऋ] becomes @deva[अर्] in @deva[अर्त्ति], @deva[इ] becomes @deva[ए] in @deva[एति].

---

## 1.1.3 - Guna and Vrddhi replace iK

**Key Terms:** iK, guRa, vRddi

When @deva[गुण] or @deva[वृद्धि] is prescribed without specifying where, it replaces @deva[इक्] (@deva[इ], @deva[उ], @deva[ऋ], @deva[ऌ]). The @deva[गुण] of @deva[इ] is @deva[ए]; of @deva[उ] is @deva[ओ]; of @deva[ऋ] is @deva[अर्]. Thus @deva[नी] + @deva[अति] = @deva[नयति].

---

## 1.1.68 - Svarupa: word form, not meaning

**Key Terms:** svaM, rUpam

In grammar, a word denotes its own form, not its meaning—except for technical terms. Rule @deva[अग्नेर्ढक्] @ref[4.2.33] applies to the word @deva[अग्नि] itself, not to synonyms like @deva[पावक].

---

## 1.1.69 - Anudit includes savarnas

**Key Terms:** aRudit, savarRa

@deva[अण्] vowels and letters marked with @deva[उ] include their @deva[सवर्ण] forms. Thus @deva[अ] includes @deva[आ]; @deva[कु] includes all five gutturals. Rule @deva[आद्गुणः] @ref[6.1.87] applies to both @deva[अ] and @deva[आ].

---

## 1.1.70 - Taparastatkaalasya

**Key Terms:** taparaH, kAla

A letter followed by @deva[त्] refers only to forms with the same prosodial length. @deva[अत्] means short @deva[अ] only, excluding @deva[आ]. Thus @deva[अतो भिस ऐस्] @ref[7.1.9] applies to @deva[वृक्ष] but not @deva[खट्वा].

---

## 1.3.2 - Nasal vowels are it

**Key Terms:** upadeSe, anunAsika, ac, it

In @deva[उपदेश], a nasal vowel is @deva[इत्]. In @deva[क्विन्] or @deva[विद्], the nasal @deva[इ] is a marker, not part of the actual affix.

---

## 1.3.3 - Final consonants are it

**Key Terms:** hal, antyam, it

The final consonant of an @deva[उपदेश] is @deva[इत्]. In the @deva[प्रत्याहार] @deva[अइउण्], the @deva[ण्] is indicatory. In @deva[ऋऌक्], the @deva[क्] is indicatory.

---

## 1.3.9 - Tasya lopah

**Key Terms:** tasya, lopaH, it

@deva[इत्] letters are elided. They serve only as mnemonics and indicators—they are not part of the final form. The @deva[लोप] applies to the whole @deva[इत्], not just its final letter.

---

## 1.4.14 - Suptiṅantam padam

**Key Terms:** sup, tiN, padam

A @deva[पद] is what ends in @deva[सुप्] or @deva[तिङ्]. @deva[ब्राह्मणाः] ends in @deva[जस्], a @deva[सुप्]; @deva[पचन्ति] ends in @deva[झि], a @deva[तिङ्].

---

## 1.4.109 - Samhita defined

**Key Terms:** saMhitA, padasya

@deva[संहिता] is the closest proximity of letters. When sounds are within half a @deva[मात्रा] of each other, @deva[सन्धि] rules apply. @deva[दधि] + @deva[अत्र] = @deva[दद्ध्यत्र].

---

## 3.1.1 - Pratyayah

**Key Terms:** pratyayaH, paraH

From here to the end of Book 5, what we treat is called @deva[प्रत्यय]. This excludes @deva[प्रकृति], @deva[उपपद], and @deva[उपधि].

---

## 3.1.2 - Paraś ca

**Key Terms:** DAtuH, pratyaya, paraH

@deva[प्रत्यय] comes after the @deva[धातु] or @deva[प्रातिपदिक]. The word @deva[च] indicates that while affixes normally follow, they may sometimes appear initially or medially.
