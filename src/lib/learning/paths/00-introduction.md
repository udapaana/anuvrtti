## 1.1.1 - Vrddhi defined

**Key Terms:** vRddi, AT,Ec

The Ashtadhyayi begins with definitions. Vrddhi refers to the "strengthened" vowel grades: ā, ai, au. These appear in specific grammatical operations like causal formation.

---

## 1.1.2 - Guna defined

**Key Terms:** guRa, at, eN

Guna refers to the "medium" vowel grades: a, e, o. Along with vrddhi, this establishes the vowel gradation (ablaut) system central to Sanskrit morphology.

---

## 1.1.3 - Guna and Vrddhi replace iK

**Key Terms:** iK, guRa, vRddi

When guna or vrddhi substitution is prescribed, it replaces the vowels i, u, ṛ, ḷ (the pratyahara iK). This tells us where vowel strengthening applies.

---

## 1.1.68 - Svan defines accent domain

**Key Terms:** svaM, rUpam

"One's own form" - when a rule mentions a sound, it refers to that sound along with its accent (svara) variations. This is a fundamental interpretive principle.

---

## 1.1.69 - Anudit includes savarnas

**Key Terms:** aRudit, savarRa

A vowel marked with anudātta (unmarked) in a rule includes all its homogeneous (savarna) variants. This expands the scope of rules efficiently.

---

## 1.1.70 - Taparastatkaalasya

**Key Terms:** taparaH, kAla

When a vowel is followed by 't' marker, it refers only to that specific vowel length, not its savarnas. This restricts scope when needed.

---

## 1.3.2 - Final consonants are it (markers)

**Key Terms:** it, hal, antyam

In grammatical terms (pratyayas, etc.), a final consonant is an 'it' (marker). It conveys grammatical information but is deleted in the final form.

---

## 1.3.3 - Initial ṣ, s, h are markers

**Key Terms:** halantyam, AdiH

Initial sibilants (ṣ, s) and h in affixes are also it-markers. For example, in 'ṣṇa' suffix, the ṣ is deleted.

---

## 1.3.9 - Tasya lopah - Markers are deleted

**Key Terms:** tasya, lopaH, it

Whatever is designated as 'it' undergoes lopa (deletion). The markers exist only to trigger rules and classify elements.

---

## 1.4.14 - Suptiṅantam padam

**Key Terms:** sup, tiN, padam

A 'pada' (complete word) is defined as that which ends in sup (nominal endings) or tiṅ (verbal endings). This defines what constitutes a word.

---

## 1.4.109 - Samhita: close contact

**Key Terms:** saMhitA, padasya

Samhita means extreme proximity of sounds. Sandhi rules apply specifically when sounds are in samhita. This defines the domain of phonological rules.

---

## 3.1.1 - Pratyayah (suffixes follow)

**Key Terms:** pratyayaH, paraH

Pratyayas (suffixes/affixes) are placed after the base they attach to. This adhikara governs the entire suffix system.

---

## 3.1.2 - Dhatoh (after verbal roots)

**Key Terms:** DAtuH, pratyaya

The suffixes taught in this section come specifically after dhatus (verbal roots). This sets up the tiṅanta (verb conjugation) system.
