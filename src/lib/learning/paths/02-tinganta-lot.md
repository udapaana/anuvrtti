## 3.3.162 - Loṭ ca

**Key Terms:** loT, viDi

The suffix 'loṭ' expresses commands, requests, and benedictions (āśīḥ). This is the imperative mood.

---

## 3.4.85 - Loṭo laṅvat

**Key Terms:** loTaH, laNvat

Loṭ endings undergo the same substitutions as laṅ endings. This links the imperative to the imperfect system.

---

## 3.4.86 - Eruh

**Key Terms:** eH, uH

In loṭ, the 'e' of the endings is replaced by 'u'. So 'te' becomes 'tu', 'se' becomes 'su'.

---

## 3.4.87 - Ser hy apic ca

**Key Terms:** seH, hi

The 'si' ending (2nd singular P) becomes 'hi' in loṭ. Hence 'bhavasi' → 'bhava' (with hi dropped after 'a').

---

## 3.4.88 - Svādiṣu sārvadhātuke ṣṭhāluṅ

**Key Terms:** svAdiSu, sArvaDAtukaH

Before sārvadhātuka affixes beginning with certain sounds, specific changes occur. Governs consonant modifications.

---

## 6.4.105 - Ato heḥ

**Key Terms:** ataH, heH

After a stem ending in 'a', the 'hi' of loṭ is deleted. So 'bhava + hi' → 'bhava'.

---

## 3.4.89 - Māṅ loṭi

**Key Terms:** mAN, loTi

The particle 'mā' is used with loṭ lakāra for prohibitions (mā bhūḥ = don't be). Negative commands.

---

## 7.1.35 - Tuhyostātaṅ āśiṣi

**Key Terms:** tu, hi, tAtaN, ASizi

In benedictions (āśīḥ), 'tu' and 'hi' endings are optionally replaced by 'tāt'. Formal blessing forms.
